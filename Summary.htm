Ted is a 12-year-old boy  who lives in Thneedville, a city where everything is made out of plastic or synthetic materials.Ted likes a girl named Audrey, who dreams about seeing a real tree, so Ted sets out to find one. His grandmother tells him to leave Thneedville to find the Once-ler. The Once-ler tells the story of the Lorax, a furry creature who cared about the trees, and the history of the Truffula Trees that the Once-ler chopped down. The Once-ler gives Ted the last Truffula tree seed, in hopes that Ted will plant it and Trufulla trees will grow again. But it's not all easy for Ted, because the greedy Aloysius O'Hare, seller of clean air, does not want Ted to improve the environment because it will hurt his business. Will Ted be able to save the citizens of Thneedville by helping the environment?
