Tips

<font size="4">

<p>If you want to do more to be good to the environment, here are some tips:</p>

<ul>

<liWhen you buy school supplies, ask your parents to get you eco-friendly ones, such as recycled paper.</li>

<li>Walk, carpool, or take the bus to school. This will help reduce carbon emissions!</li>

<li>Turn off the lights when you're not using them. That way, you don't waste energy and money!</li>

<li>RECYCLE! Paper, juice cartons, aluminum cans, plastic bags and plastic bottles can all be recycled. Make sure to recycle these things instead of throwing them out!</li>

<li>Turn off the tap when you're not using. If you're brushing your teeth turn the tap off while you brush, and then turn it on again. </li>

<li>Start a compost bin! Talk to your parents about how to get started. Composting is a great way to turn organic waste products into something useful -- fertilizer.</li>

<li>And last but not least, plant a tree. Just like Ted in The Lorax, planting a tree can make you a hero! Get a bunch of friends and adults to come together and plant trees.</li>

</ul>
